Fringe is a framework agnostic **edge-runtime for serveless functions and graphql**.

It's inspired by frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [flareact](https://flareact.com/)

It supports following:

- File Based routing
- Dynamic API routes
- Serverless functions running at edge
- Serverless GraphQL - GraphQL queries running at edge

**Serveless GraphQL**

This is a POC to run GraphQL at edge along with caching responses in a normalized form at edge. Just declare your GraphQL queries in .graphql files during your development.

Project Structure:

The about.graphql can be run at REST endpoint http://localhost:8080/about/graphql/about

***Advantages***
1.) Removes all GraphQL client boilerplate from frontend builds.
2.) The model offers protection of origin GraphQL Server behind edge.
3.) Improves developer experience with more focus on business at hand than on setup.
4.) Write your component and define your GraphQL and keep them side by side with zero additional setup.
5.) Even execute GraphQL queries/mutations via file based routing for GraphQL.ðŸ”¥

(In-progress :ðŸŒ˜ ðŸ‘‡)
6.) Normalized Caching at edge of GraphQL results can offer better performance and again reduce the boilerplate for server codes.
